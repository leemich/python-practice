Repo for scripts written while learning Python

This is a beginner's repo for scripts I'm writing while learning to program in Python.

I expect there will be a lot of kludged together code that (hopefully) improves as I learn more.
This is mostly for my own sanity as I code on two different computers and want access to 
all of my scripts from both machines. It is also helping me get more comfortable with Git.

Please excuse the mess!

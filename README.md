Repo for scripts written while learning Python

This is a beginner's repo for scripts I'm writing while learning to program in Python.

I expect there will be a lot of kludged together code that (hopefully) improves as I learn more.
This is mostly for my own sanity as I code on two different computers and want access to 
all of my scripts from both machines. It is also helping me get more comfortable with Git.

Some of these scripts are exercises and examples from http://programarcadegames.com/

Some are exercises from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyqD2_oDtiQIh_Y55J5RfeA91JJECc97xYIKM112H9I/edit

Some are exercises from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/

And some are my own exercises and tests.

Please excuse the mess!

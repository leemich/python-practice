NOTES ON PYTHON
Stuff I want to remember

random.randint() is inclusive of the end of the range,
and does not take a step argument

random.randrange() is not inclusive of the end of the range,
like other range functions, and allows you to specify
a step.

------------------

Use global x to modify a global variable inside of a function's
local scope.

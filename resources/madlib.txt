The adj1 girl stopped at the top of the mountain to take in the view. It had
been a adj2 climb, but she had finally arrived at her destination - a adj3
little noun1 overlooking the noun2 below.

She took one last look and ptverb1 up the stairs to the front door. She
ptverb2, and after a brief pause, a adj4 old man adv1 opened the door
and beckoned her inside.

"Did you bring the package?" he asked.

"Yes," she said. She took the adv2 wrapped box and placed it on a adj5
noun3 by the door.

"Thank you, my noun4. You can be on your way now." He ptverb3 at her
and ptverb4 his arm toward the still-open door.

She ptverb5. "Don't you want to verb1 it?"

He ptverb6 his eyes to the package, and his smile widened. He looked back at
her with barely concealed emot1. "No, darling. I think I'll verb2 until morning.
You be careful going back down the path. It's going to be adj6 soon."

The girl ptverb7 him adv3 before returning his smile with a confused
noun5 of her own. "Ok, mister. Have a nice noun6!"

She ptverb8 and walked toward the gravel path that wound gently down the
noun7 and into a dense noun8 of noun9. She heard the door close behind
her, sighed adv4, and headed back home.
